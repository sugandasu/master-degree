# Deep Optics for Monocular Depth Estimation and 3D Object Detection

## Journal

ICCV Open Access

## Authors

- [Julie Chang](jchang10@stanford.edu) Stanford University
- [Gordon Wetzstein](gordon.wetzstein@stanford.edu) Stanford University

## Dataset

- NYU Depth v2 dataset with standard splits
- (3) a subset of the KITTI depth dataset (5500 train, 749 val)

## Training

- ADAM optimizer with a mean-square-error (MSE) loss on the logarithmic depth
- 40,000 iterations at a learning rate of .001 (decayed to 1e-4 for the Rectangles dataset) and batch size of 3


## Method

- Artificial Neural Network
- Paradigm of deep optics, i.e. end-to-end design of optics and image processing,
- Using coded defocus blur as an additional depth cue to be decoded by a neural network
- Optimization of Lens for depth estimation
- CNN-based estimation methods

## Result

- Optimization on hardware do contibute to increase in accuracy

## Shortcoming

- Accuracy is not better than other leading reseach using only use monocular input
- Uncertain the approach surpass existing methods.
