# 3D Packing for Self-Supervised Monocular Depth Estimation

## Journal

2020 IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR)

## Authors

- Vitor Guizilini
- Rares Ambrus
- Sudeep Pillai
- Allan Raventos
- Adrien Gaidon

## Dataset

- New dataset: Dense Depth for Automated Driving (DDAD). It leverages diverse logs from a ï¬‚eet of well-calibrated self-driving cars equipped with cameras and high-accuracy long-range LiDARs. Compared to existing benchmarks, DDAD enables much more accurate depth evaluation at range, which is key for high resolution monocular depth estimation methods 
- NuScenes datase
- New proposed DDAD benchmark

## Training

## Method

- New convolutional network architecture, called PackNet, for high-resolution self-supervised monocular depth estimation
- KITTI benchmark

## Result

## Shortcoming
